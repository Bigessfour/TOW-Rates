# Enhanced Trash Enterprise Business Rules
## Date: July 1, 2025 - Implementation Phase

### Core Business Logic Improvements

#### 1. Asset Management & Depreciation
- **New Trash Truck**: $350,000 capital expense
  - 12-year useful life = $29,166.67 annual depreciation
  - 10% maintenance reserve = $35,000 annual
  - **Total Annual Cost**: $32,083.34 ($2,673.61 monthly)
  - **Rate Impact**: 2.67% increase on base sewage sales

#### 2. Enhanced Scenario Calculations
- **Scenario 1**: New Trash Truck (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
  - Collections: Full truck cost + maintenance reserves
  - Revenue: 2.67% rate increase distributed by allocation
  - Equipment: Full depreciation + 10% maintenance reserve
  
- **Scenario 2**: Recycling Program Expansion ($125,000, 7 years)
  - Annual cost: $20,373.52 ($1,697.79 monthly)
  - Focus on recycling processing equipment
  - Revenue offset from improved material recovery
  
- **Scenario 3**: Transfer Station & Route Optimization ($200,000, 15 years)
  - Annual cost: $17,157.24 ($1,429.77 monthly)
  - Operations efficiency gains
  - Route optimization cost savings

#### 3. Validation Rules Enhancement
- **Account Prefixes**: All trash accounts should start with "T"
- **Collection Rates**: Residential ($15-30), Commercial ($45 typical)
- **Tonnage Tracking**: Monthly usage field for waste volumes
- **Equipment Reserves**: Minimum 10% of asset value
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Typically 15-25% for waste operations

#### 4. Section-Specific Business Rules

##### Revenue Section
- Track rate increases needed for capital investments
- Apply percentage allocations based on enterprise distribution
- Monitor customer affordability impact

##### Collections Section  
- Direct impact from new equipment acquisition
- Route efficiency improvements with new truck
- Seasonal volume variations (holidays, summer activities)

##### Recycling Section
- Cost per ton processing efficiency
- Material recovery revenue tracking
- Environmental compliance costs

##### Operations Section
- Fuel and maintenance cost tracking
- Disposal facility tipping fees
- Administrative overhead allocation

##### Equipment Section
- Asset depreciation schedules
- Maintenance reserve requirements
- Replacement planning cycles

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Cost per Ton**: Target < $150/ton collected
- **Fleet Utilization**: Track truck efficiency metrics
- **Route Optimization**: Monitor collection time/cost
- **Recycling Rate**: Percentage of waste diverted
- **Budget Variance**: Monthly actual vs. planned

### Financial Controls
- **Capital Reserve**: 20% of total budget for equipment
- **Maintenance Reserve**: 10% of asset values annually
- **Rate Adjustment**: Annual review with 2.67% baseline for truck
- **Emergency Reserve**: 5% for unexpected repairs/replacement

### Integration Points
- **Summary Page**: Cross-enterprise impact calculations
- **Sewer Enterprise**: Shared administrative costs allocation
- **Rate Setting**: Coordinated rate adjustments across all enterprises
- **Reporting**: Monthly budget vs. actual analysis

This enhanced business logic transforms the Trash enterprise from placeholder status to a fully functional budget management system that properly accounts for the critical $350,000 truck acquisition and ongoing operational needs.
